  This tool allows users to perform an automated workflow to analyze, validate and visualize large HDX-MS datasets. The input file is the output of DynamX software from Waters. Output files provide a plot of the data, the fitted model for each peptide, a plot of the calculated p -values, and a global visualization of the experiment. User could also obtain an overview of all peptides on the 3D structure.
